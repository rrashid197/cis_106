# File Server
<hr>







## Different file server application

One of the most common ways to network Ubuntu and Windows computers is to configure Samba as a File Server. This section covers setting up a Samba server to share files with Windows clients. The server will be configured to share files with any client on the network without prompting for a password.

The first step is to install the samba package. On configuration, main Samba configuration file is located in /etc/samba/smb.conf. The default configuration file has a significant number of comments in order to document various configuration directives.




### Samba


![sambapic](samba.png)

Samba  is a software package that gives network administrators flexibility and freedom in terms of setup, configuration, and choice of systems and equipment. it is the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix.


### Set static ip address 


![ipadresspic](ipaddress.png)

Steps to set static ip address.

**Step 1**:Open GNOME setting window on ubuntu machine.

**Step 2**:Click on network tab.

**Step 3**:Select IPv4.

**Step 4**:In IPv4 method tab enable Manual option which let user set static ip address.

**Step 5**:In Address tab enter the ip address.

**Step 6**:Click apply to set the static ip address.

![ippic](image.png)

### Configuring the firewall


![firewallpic](firewall.png)

Securing a network with an uncomplicated firewall (UFW)  in ubuntu  is super easy and highly recommended.

**Step 1** - Set Up default UFW policies.

The default policy firewall works out great for both the servers and desktop. It is always a good policy to closes all ports on the server and open only required ports one by one.

Enabling IPv6 support

Make sure the directive IPV6=yes do exists in /etc/default/ufw file.

**Step 2** - Open SSH TCP port 22 connections

The next logical step is to allow incoming SSH ports. We can easily open SSH TCP port 22 using UFW.

**Step 3** - Turn on firewall

Now we got basic configuration enabled. In other words, the firewall will drop all incoming traffic except for ssh TCP port 22. Let us true it on the UFW. Remember, once UFW enabled, it runs across system reboots too.

**Step 4** - Open specific incoming connections/ports

Let us add more rules. Say you want to open ports and allow IP address with ufw.

Allow port ranges via ufw

We can allow port ranges too say, tcp and udp 3000 to 4000:

**Step 5** - Block and deny incoming connections/ports

Do you want to close ports and block certain IP addresses? The syntax is as follows to deny access. In other words, simply ignoring access to port 25:
sudo ufw deny 25/tcp

**Step 6** - Verify status of UFW

**Use the status command**











### How to install the server application you chose

![serverpic](install.png)

Download the Ubuntu Server installation file into a USB stick (or DVD).

Boot up the machine from USB or DVD (e.g., Hit F11 for the Boot menu, and choose UEFI Boot from USB. UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is a replacement for BIOS.

Follow the instructions to install the server:

- Select your language and location.

- In "Network Configuration", choose your network card (eth0 for the first network card). If you have an static IP number, choose "Configure the network manually". Otherwise, use DHCP (which is the default) for dynamic IP.

- Enter your chosen "hostname".

- Enter the "username" and "password" for the system administrator. Select "no" to encrypt the home directory. By default, Ubuntu creates but locks up the root user for security. Do not user root here.

- Set your time zone.

- For hard disk partition, select "Use entire disk and setup LVM (Logical Volume Manager)". Select the entire disk space for LVM. The installer will create the \boot, \swap and the \ (root) partitions on "sda" (the first disk). You can check the partitions via "lsblk" (list block devices) command or Webmin later.

- Leave blank for HTTP proxy information.

- Select "No Automatic Update". We will run manual update later.

- For packages, select Ubuntu Server, OPEN SSH, LAMP (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP), SAMBA (File and Print services for Windows clients), Mail (Local) Server, Postfix (Local) Mail Server, and PostgreSQL. Select other packages if needed.

- Set the root password for MySQL, if LAMP was selected.

- Select "yes" to GRUB boot loader. GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) is a Multiboot boot loader.

- Reboot the machine, and login as the system administrator you created earlier.



### Basic commands about managing the server application

![commandspic](command.png)

Ubuntu features a comprehensive package management system for installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software.

Ubuntu's package management system is derived from the same system used by the Debian GNU/Linux distribution. The package files contain all of the necessary files, meta-data, and instructions to implement a particular functionality or software application on your Ubuntu computer.

Debian package files typically have the extension .deb, and usually exist in repositories which are collections of packages found online or on physical media, such as CD-ROM discs. Packages are normally in a pre-compiled binary format; thus installation is quick and requires no compiling of software.

Many packages use dependencies which  are additional packages required by the principal package in order to function properly.

- The apt command is a powerful command-line tool, which works with Ubuntu's Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) performing such functions as installation of new software packages, upgrade of existing software packages, updating of the package list index, and even upgrading the entire Ubuntu system.
    
- Launching Aptitude with no command-line options will give you a menu-driven, text-based front-end to the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) system. Many of the common package management functions, such as installation, removal, and upgrade, can be performed in Aptitude with single-key commands, which are typically lowercase letters.

Aptitude is best suited for use in a non-graphical terminal environment to ensure proper functioning of the command keys.

- dpkg is a package manager for Debian-based systems. It can install, remove, and build packages, but unlike other package management systems, it cannot automatically download and install packages or their dependencies. Apt and Aptitude are newer, and layer additional features on top of dpkg.

- APT Configuration

Configuration of the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) system repositories is stored in the /etc/apt/sources.list file and the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory. An example of this file is referenced here, along with information on adding or removing repository references from the file.

You may edit the file to enable repositories or disable them. For example, to disable the requirement of inserting the Ubuntu CD-ROM whenever package operations occur, simply comment out the appropriate line for the CD-ROM, which appears at the top of the file.



### How to start, terminate, and restart a service in Ubuntu

When an application runs in the background, it's called a service. These are essential to run the system or our software applications. Some of the common services you will find on most of the servers are Apache, MySQL, NGINX, etc. When the system boots up, these services are configured to automatically startup.

Using systemctl to start, stop, and restart Ubuntu services

This is the preferred way to manage Ubuntu services. If you are not sure of the service name, you can run systemctl --all command to list all the services. But, there might be hundreds of services running, so it's better to filter the list using the grep command.

- Stop service using systemctl. # systemctl stop mysql.service. ...
    
- Checking Service Status using systemctl. We can check the service status using the below command. ...
    
- Start service using systemctl. # systemctl start mysql.service. ...
    
- Restart service using systemctl.





### You must be able to access this file server in your regular vm (the one you use in the class) and your windows computer
